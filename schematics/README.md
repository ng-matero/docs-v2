# Schematics

Schematics is a powerful feature of the Angular ecosystem. You can quickly add project directories or generate common business templates through Schematics.

Currently, ng-matero implements the functions of `ng add` and `ng generate`. It will add `ng update` later making convenient for upgrading and maintenance of ng-matero project. At the same time, I will continue to improve `ng generate` and provide more commonly used business templates.

* [ng add](project-init.md)
* [ng generate](new-route.md)
* ng update
