# Helpers

CSS helpers plays a very important role in the real world. Based on the Angular Material component library and CSS Helpers, we almost don't need to write redundant styles any more. It also avoids the problem of global style overwriting or minimizes the risks. CSS Helpers should be used for adjusting details.

I have written a [CSS helper libary](https://github.com/snack-ui/snack-helper) a few years ago.

Ng-Matero' CSS helpers follows Material design principles, the numbers are mostly multiples of 4, e.g. padding helpers `p-4` `p-8` `p-16` `p-24`. This will ensure the uniformity of the interface style to the greatest extent.

## About Color

Color helpers is divided into background color and text color. Background colors add `.bg-` prefix and the text colors add `.text-` prefix.

## Available CSS Helpers

See [Ng-Matero Helpers](https://ng-matero.github.io/ng-matero/#/helpers/css-class) for details.
